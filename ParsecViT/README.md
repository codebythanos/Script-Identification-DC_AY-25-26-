# PARSeq-style Vision Transformer for Script Identification

This directory contains multiple implementations of a PARSeq-style Vision Transformer model for Indian language script identification. Each model version explores different configurations and improvements over the baseline.

---

## Overview

The models in this folder are based on Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures and are implemented using PyTorch and the `timm` library. These models are designed to classify text images into one of 12 Indian script classes.

Each version includes:
- Training and evaluation pipeline
- Patch-based ViT configurations
- Performance comparison across different settings

## Installation

Navigate to this directory:

```bash
cd ParseqViT

Install dependencies for the required model:

Example for Model 3:

pip install -r requirement_Model3_parsec.txt

Similarly:

Model1 → requirement_Model1_parsec.txt
Model2 → requirement_Model2_parsec.txt
Usage

Run the desired model:

Example:

python Model3_parsec.py

Similarly:

python Model1_parsec.py
python Model2_parsec.py
Dataset

Update dataset paths inside the script before running.

Expected structure:

dataset/
├── train_1800/
├── test_478/

Each folder contains subdirectories corresponding to script classes.
